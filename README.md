# BibleReader
A simple Bible reader I made in Lazarus. It only has a few features at the moment. The KJV.zip must be extracted to folder KJV and placed in the same directory as the executable.

This is compiled in Lazrus under Manjaro Linux

### Description ###
```
I wanted a simple iinterface that would allow me to read the Bible or other Txt files in a "book style" aspect ratio. Most of the other Bible software I found uses either and extremely cluttered or screen filling interface which makes it difficult to read.
